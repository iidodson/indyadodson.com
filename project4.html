    <h2 class="section--title section--title-projecthead">Pantone Portable</h2>
    <h3 class="section--description"> While picking out paint for a new office space, I found myself wishing I had a pantone booklet. And then I thought to myself, why don't I just make one?

    <h2 class="section--title section--title-article">The Concept</h2>
    <p class="project--paragraph">The concept came from wanting to view a Pantone booklet without having an actual booklet. My natural thought process led me to believe an app was the best solution to problem because its on a phone, making it portable and easily accessible.
 <br>  <br> I wanted to make the experience as close to the real thing as I could. I wanted to mimic the way you are able to pick through pages in the booklet until you find the perfect color.</p>
  <h2 class="section--title section--title-article">The Logo: Reimaging Color Palettes Gradients
 </h2>
  <p class="project--paragraph">Color gradient palettes are commonly used in Pantone related things. An example of this is their Pantone app logo and book written about Pantone colors. </p>
  <p class="project--paragraph">I initially played around with the brightness gradient but decided to freshen up the look without it straying too far from the original branding by creating a hue gradient.</p>

<h2 class="section--title section--title-article">Designing the Interface and Interaction</h2>
<p class="project--paragraph">Since this was the first version, I wanted to keep the interface as simple of possible. My initial approach behind the way users would select a color was that they would be given a list of
   basic colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and black and they would select from that list. Once they chose a color, a swatch page could display where they could swipe through and see all colors in
   that color family.The problem with this approach was that it doesnâ€™t allow the user to quickly access a variation of a color. Say someone is looking for a mustard, not just yellow, they would have to do a lot of scrolling to get there.
</p>
<p class="project--paragraph">My second approach was displaying a color wheel, which gave the user more available brightness and hues of each color to chose from initially.

<h2 class="section--title section--title-article">The Swatches</h2>
<p class="project--paragraph">I wanted this part of the experience to be as consistent as possible with Pantone booklet. I created a nearly identical interface and allowed the user to swipe through each page similar to how one can pick through pages in the booklets.
